    <h2> Pikachu </h2>

    <p>Whenever Pikachu comes across something new, it blasts it with a jolt of electricity. If you come across a blackened berry, it's evidence that this Pokemon mistook the intensity of its charge. </p>
    
    <h2> Ditto </h2>
    <img src=https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/132.png>
    <p> Ditto rearranges its cell structure to transform itself into other shapes. However, if it tries to transform itself into something by relying on its memory, this Pokemon manages to get details wrong. </p>
    
    <h2> Infernape </h2>

    <p> Its crown of fire is indicative of its fiery nature. It is beaten by none in terms of quickness. </p>

    <h2> Lucario </h2>
    <img src=https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/448.png>
    <p> By catching the aura emanating from others, it can read their thoughts and movements.  </p>

    <h2> Arceus </h2>
    <img src=https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/493.png>
    <p> According to the legends of Sinnoh, this Pokemon emerged from an egg and shaped all there is in this world. </p>

    <h2> Victini </h2>
    <img src=https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/494.png>
    <p>This Pokemon brings victory. It is said that Trainers with Victini always win, regardless of the type of encounter. </p>
